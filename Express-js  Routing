Web frameworks provide resources such as HTML pages, scripts, images, etc. at different routes.


The following function is used to define routes in an Express application −

app.method(path, handler)
This METHOD can be applied to any one of the HTTP verbs – get, set, put, delete. 
An alternate method also exists, which executes independent of the request type.

Path is the route at which the request will run.

Handler is a callback function that executes when a matching request type is found on the relevant route. 

For example,
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
app.get('/hello', function(req, res){
   res.send("Hello World!");
});
app.listen(3000);

If we run our application and go to localhost:3000/hello,
the server receives a get request at route "/hello", our Express app executes the callback
function attached to this route and sends "Hello World!" as the response.


We can also have multiple different methods at the same route. For example,
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
app.get('/hello', function(req, res){
   res.send("Hello World!");
});
app.post('/hello', function(req, res){
   res.send("You just called the post method at '/hello'!\n");
});
app.listen(3000);


A special method, all, is provided by Express to handle all types of 
http methods at a particular route using the same function.
his method is generally used for defining middleware,
