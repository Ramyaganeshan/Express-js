express()
Creates an Express application. The express() function is a top-level function exported by the express module.

var express = require('express')
var app = express()


METHODS:-
express.json([options])
express.json() is a middleware function in the Express.js framework,
which is a popular Node.js web application framework.
Middleware functions in Express.js are essentially functions that have access
to the request and response objects, and they can perform various tasks 
such as parsing request data, authentication, logging, and more.

Specifically, express.json() is used to parse incoming JSON data from 
the body of the HTTP request. When a client sends data to the server in JSON format,
it is typically included in the request body. For example, in a POST request,
the client might send JSON data representing a new user, an update to an existing record,
or any other relevant information.

By using express.json() as middleware in your Express application,
you enable the server to automatically parse the JSON data from the request body
and make it available in the req.body object of the subsequent route handlers.
This makes it easy for developers to work with incoming JSON data without having to manually parse it.

Syntax
express.json([options])

Parameters/options:
Following are the different options available with this method
inflate – This enables or disables the handling of the deflated or compressed bodies. Default: true
limit – This controls the maximum size of the request body.
reviver – This option is passed to the JSON.parse method as the second argument.
strict – This enables or disables the accepting arrays or objects.
type – This determines the media type for the middleware that will be parsed.



2.express.raw()
In Express.js, express.raw() is a middleware function that is used to handle 
raw binary data in the request body. It is one of the built-in middleware functions
provided by Express to process incoming requests before they reach the route handlers.

By default, Express.js does not handle raw binary data in the request body, such as
images or other non-textual content. Instead, it primarily focuses on handling JSON
data (express.json()) and URL-encoded form data (express.urlencoded()).

However, in some cases, you may need to handle raw binary data directly,
for example, when receiving files or binary data from a client application. 
This is where express.raw() comes into play. It allows you to parse and 
access the raw binary data from the request body, which you can then process or store as needed.

To use express.raw(), you need to add it as middleware to your Express application before defining any routes.
Here's an example of how you can use it:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to handle raw binary data from the request body
app.use(express.raw({ type: 'application/octet-stream', limit: '10mb' }));

// Route handler for handling the request with raw binary data
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  const rawData = req.body; // The raw binary data from the request body
  // Process the raw data (e.g., save it to a file, process an image, etc.)
  console.log(rawData);
  res.status(200).send('Raw data received successfully.');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
In the example above, we're using express.raw() middleware to handle 
raw binary data with a specified type of application/octet-stream, which
is a general type for binary data. We've also set a limit of '10mb', which
means the maximum allowed size of the raw data is 10 megabytes.

Keep in mind that when using express.raw(), you need to ensure that 
the client application sends the appropriate content type and encoding for the 
raw data being transmitted, and you may need to adjust the type parameter accordingly in the middleware configuration.


3.express.router()
express.Router() is a built-in middleware function in the Express.js web framework 
that provides a way to create modular and mountable route handlers.
It allows you to organize and define routes for specific functionalities or parts
of your web application separately, which promotes better code organization and maintainability.

With express.Router(), you can define a group of related routes and middleware as a
mini "sub-application" that can be used within your main Express application.
This is particularly useful when you have multiple routes and route handlers 
that are related to a specific feature or functionality in your application.


4.express.text()
In Express.js, express.text() is a built-in middleware function that is used to handle
plain text data in the request body. It automatically parses the text data sent by the 
client and makes it available in the req.body object of subsequent route handlers.

By default, Express.js does not handle plain text data in the request body.
It primarily focuses on handling JSON data (express.json()), URL-encoded form data 
(express.urlencoded()), and raw binary data (express.raw()).

However, in some cases, you may need to handle plain text data directly, 
for example, when working with APIs that expect text-based payloads.
This is where express.text() comes into play. It allows you to parse and access 
the plain text data from the request body easily.

To use express.text(), you need to add it as middleware to your Express 
application before defining any routes. 



5.express.urlencoded()
In Express.js, express.urlencoded() is a built-in middleware function that is used to parse URL-encoded 
form data from the request body. URL-encoded form data is commonly used when submitting HTML forms,
and it consists of key-value pairs encoded in the URL format.

For example, when a client submits a form with the following data:

html
Copy code
<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="username" value="John">
  <input type="email" name="email" value="john@example.com">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
The data will be sent to the server in the URL-encoded format:

makefile
Copy code
username=John&email=john%40example.com
To extract and parse this data on the server side,
you can use express.urlencoded() middleware.
It will parse the URL-encoded data from the request body and
make it available in the req.body object of subsequent route handlers.

Here's an example of how to use express.urlencoded() in an Express application:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse URL-encoded form data from the request body
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Route handler for handling form submission
app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  const username = req.body.username;
  const email = req.body.email;

  // Process the form data
  console.log('Username:', username);
  console.log('Email:', email);

  res.send('Form data received successfully.');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
In the example above, we're using 
express.urlencoded() middleware with the extended:
true option. This option allows the parsing of rich objects and arrays from the URL-encoded data.

With the express.urlencoded() middleware in place, 
when a POST request is made to the /submit endpoint with URL-encoded form data, 
the data will be available in the req.body object of the route handler.
You can then access the form fields by their names (in this case, username and email) and process the data as needed.

Using express.urlencoded() is essential when you want to handle form submissions 
or any other requests that send data in the URL-encoded format. It simplifies the 
process of parsing and accessing form data in your Express application.
