if your friend ask you to book a train ticket for him.
you said OK.
and your friend said .. if the train ticket is confromed give me a message "sucess" or else give me a message "failiur".
You said SURE! ----> That is what Promise.
If the ticket is  conformed  ---> that is called resolved
If the ticked is not confrom ---> that is called reject


How to write it in a code:
const bookticket = new promise((resolve, reject) =>{
let bookingsuccess = true;
if (bookingsuccess)
       reslove()
else
       reject()
)}

bookticket.then(success)
.ctach(failure)


Another Example:
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function myDisplayer(some) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
}

let myPromise = new Promise(function(myResolve, myReject) {
  let x = 0;

  if (x == 0) {
    myResolve("OK");
  } else {
    myReject("Error");
  }
});

myPromise.then(
  function(value) {myDisplayer(value);},
  function(error) {myDisplayer(error);}
);
</script>
