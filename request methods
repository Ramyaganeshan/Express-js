In Express.js, a "request" refers to the incoming HTTP request made by a client
(typically a web browser) to the server. Express.js is a popular web application
framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.

When a client makes an HTTP request to a server running an Express.js application,
the request contains information such as:

HTTP Method: The type of request, like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.,
indicating the action the client wants to perform.

URL (Uniform Resource Locator): The specific endpoint or
resource on the server that the client is trying to access.

Headers: Additional metadata sent by the client,
including information such as the client's user agent, content type, and more.

Parameters: In the case of HTTP methods like POST or PUT,
data can be sent in the request body, containing information for the server to process.

Query Parameters: For GET requests, additional data can be sent in the URL 
as query parameters, which the server can use to customize the response.

Express.js provides a convenient way to handle these incoming requests and 
extract relevant data from them. For example, you can access the request method, 


Request Methods:-
1.req.app():
In Express.js, the req.app property is a way to access the main Express application
instance from within a route handler or middleware. It allows you to refer back to the
main express() application object that you created when setting up your server.

When you create an Express application, you do it like this:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

The app object is the main Express application instance, and you use it to define routes, middleware,
and other settings for your web server.

Now, whenever you handle incoming requests with your route handlers or middleware, 
the req (request) object is passed as a parameter to these functions. The req object 
contains information about the incoming request, such as the request headers, URL parameters, 
form data, etc.

With req.app, you can access the main Express application instance 
(the app object) from within any route handler or middleware. 
This can be useful when you want to:

Access application-level settings: If you have set certain properties or configurations
on the main app object, you can access them using req.app.
Share data across different route handlers or middleware: You can store data on the main app
object and retrieve it in other parts of your application using req.app.

Here's a simplified example:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Set an application-level setting
app.set('appName', 'My Express App');

// Middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Access the main Express application instance using req.app
  const mainApp = req.app;

  // Access the application-level setting (appName)
  const appName = mainApp.get('appName');

  console.log('Application Name:', appName);

  next();
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Access the main Express application instance using req.app
  const mainApp = req.app;

  // Access the application-level setting (appName)
  const appName = mainApp.get('appName');

  res.send(`Welcome to ${appName}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
In this example, we set an application-level setting called appName 
using app.set('appName', 'My Express App'). The middleware and route 
handler both access this setting using req.app.get('appName') and use i
t to display the application name in the console and in the
URL, headers, and body through the request object in your Express.js route handlers.

Here's a simple example of an Express.js route handler that responds differently based on the incoming request:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Route handler for handling GET requests to the root URL
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, this is the homepage!');
});

// Route handler for handling POST requests to the root URL
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('You sent a POST request!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on http://localhost:3000');
});
In this example, when a client sends a GET request to the root URL (/),
the server will respond with "Hello, this is the homepage!" But if a client 
sends a POST request to the same URL, the server will respond with "You sent a POST request!" 
The req object in each route handler contains all the information about the incoming request, 
allowing you to differentiate and handle the requests accordingly.





2.req.body():
body: In the context of a request, body refers to the data that is sent by 
the client in the HTTP request's body. The body can contain various types of data,
such as form data, JSON data, or even binary data.
To access the data in the request body, you typically use a middleware called body-parser,
which is commonly used in Express applications. With body-parser, 
you can parse the request body and make it available in the req.body object.

Here's an example of using body-parser to parse JSON data from the request body:
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

// Parse JSON data from the request body
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Define a POST route that expects JSON data in the request body
app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body; // Access the parsed JSON data from req.body
  console.log(data);
  res.send('Data received successfully!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
In this example, when a client makes a POST request to the "/data"
endpoint with JSON data in the request body, body-parser parses the JSON 
data and makes it available in the req.body object within the route handler.



3.req.params:
In Express.js, req.params is an object that contains the values of named parameters from the URL. 
When you define a route with named parameters in the route path,
Express captures those values and makes them accessible through the req.params object.

Define a Route with Named Parameter:
When you define a route in Express, you can specify named parameters by using a colon (:) 
followed by the parameter name in the route path. For example:

app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Route handler code
});

In this case, the route has a named parameter id, and it will capture the value from the URL.

Send a Request to the Route:
When a client sends a request to this route with a value for the id parameter,
Express will capture that value and store it in the req.params object.
For example, if the client sends a GET request to /users/123, where 123 is the
value for the id parameter, the req.params object will look like this:
{
  "id": "123"
}

Accessing the Parameter Value:
Inside the route handler, you can access the value of the named parameter using req.params.parameterName. 

app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});
When the client sends a request to /users/123,
the route handler will extract the value 123 from req.params.id and respond with "User ID: 123".

This is particularly useful when you have dynamic URLs with variable parts, 
like user IDs, post IDs, or any other resource identifier.
The named parameters allow you to handle different resources based on the values provided in the URL.


4.req.query:
In Express.js, req.query is an object that contains the parsed query parameters
from the URL of a GET request. Query parameters are the key-value pairs added 
to the URL after the question mark (?) and separated by ampersands (&).
They are typically used to send data to the server as part of the URL.

For example, consider the following URL:
http://example.com/search?q=express.js&page=1

In this URL, there are two query parameters:
q with the value "express.js" and page with the value "1".

The req.query object will look like this:
{
  "q": "express.js",
  "page": "1"
}

Here's how you can use req.query in your Express.js route handler:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
  // Access the query parameters using req.query
  const searchTerm = req.query.q;
  const page = req.query.page;

  res.send(`Search Term: ${searchTerm}, Page: ${page}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
In this example, when a client makes a GET request to the "/search" endpoint
with the URL containing query parameters, the route handler can access the values of those parameters using req.query.

For instance:
Request: GET /search?q=express.js&page=1
req.query.q will be "express.js"
req.query.page will be "1"

Using req.query, you can easily extract and use the data sent by the client
in the URL query parameters. This is commonly used for search functionality,
pagination, filtering, and more in web applications.
