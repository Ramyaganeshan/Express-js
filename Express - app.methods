In Express.js, an "application" refers to the main instance of the Express framework.
When you create an Express application using const app = express();, the app variable represents 
the application object. This application object is central to your Express application and
provides the core functionality to handle HTTP requests, define routes, set up middleware, and more.

Here's how the application object is used in Express.js:

Handling HTTP requests:
The application object is the foundation for handling incoming HTTP requests.
You can define routes to match specific URLs and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) 
using methods like app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete(), etc.

Example:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});


Adding middleware:
Middleware functions can be added to the application using the app.use() method.
Middleware functions are executed sequentially for every incoming request and
can perform tasks such as parsing request bodies, authentication, logging, error handling, and more.

Example:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Logger middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request received at ${new Date()}`);
  next();
});



app -- methods:-

1.app.all()
In Express.js, app.all() is a method that is used to define a middleware function 
that will be executed for every type of HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) on a specific route.
It is often used when you want to apply the same middleware logic to all types of requests on a particular route.

The syntax for app.all() is as follows:
app.all(path, callback)

path: The URL path for which the middleware should be executed.
It can be a specific route path or a pattern (e.g., "/users/:id" to match "/users/123" or "/users/abc").
callback: The middleware function that will be executed for each request to the specified path. 
It takes the usual (req, res, next) parameters.

Here's an example:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function to be executed for all requests to "/example"
app.all('/example', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('This middleware is executed for all requests to "/example"');
  next();
});

// Route handler for GET request to "/example"
app.get('/example', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request to /example');
});

// Route handler for POST request to "/example"
app.post('/example', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to /example');
});

In this example, the middleware defined using app.all('/example', ...) 
will be executed for both GET and POST requests to the "/example" path. 
So, if you make a request to "/example" (either GET or POST),
the middleware will log the message specified in the callback function
before passing control to the appropriate route handler.

app.all() is useful when you want to enforce certain checks or apply common 
logic across all request methods for a specific route.
For instance, you might use it to enforce authentication for all requests to 
a particular route or to log information about every incoming request to a specific path. 
It offers a convenient way to apply middleware to multiple request methods on a particular
route without having to duplicate code in each method-specific handler.



2.app.delet()
In Express.js, app.delete() is a method that is used to define a route handler 
for handling HTTP DELETE requests to a specific path or URL. When a DELETE request is made to the specified route,
the corresponding route handler function will be executed.

The syntax for app.delete() is similar to other HTTP methods in Express.js:

app.delete(path, callback)

Here's an example:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // Logic to delete the user with the specified userId from the database
  res.send(`User with ID ${userId} has been deleted.`);
});
In this example, when a DELETE request is made to a path like "/users/123" or "/users/abc",
the route handler function will be executed.
It will extract the id parameter from the request URL using req.params.id and 
then perform some logic (e.g., deleting the user with that ID from a database). 
Finally, it will send a response back to the client with a message indicating that the user has been deleted.

Remember that the HTTP DELETE method is used to request the removal of a resource specified by the URL.
Therefore, when implementing a DELETE route, ensure that the server takes the appropriate action to delete
the resource or perform the operation associated with the request.



3.app.disable()
In Express.js, app.disable() is a method used to disable a specific feature 
or setting of the Express application. It allows you to turn off certain functionalities 
based on your application's needs or specific requirements.

The syntax for app.disable() is as follows:
app.disable(setting)
setting: The setting you want to disable.
It can be one of the various application-level settings that Express supports,
such as 'etag', 'x-powered-by', 'query parser', 'strict routing', etc.

Here's an example of using app.disable() to turn off the 'x-powered-by' header:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Disable 'x-powered-by' header
app.disable('x-powered-by');

// Define route handlers
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
In this example, by using app.disable('x-powered-by'), the 'x-powered-by'
header will not be sent in the response when clients make requests to the server. 
The 'x-powered-by' header typically displays the name of the framework used (e.g., Express),
but disabling it can be a security measure to hide implementation details.

Similarly, you can use app.disable() to turn off other settings like the 'etag' header,
which can be useful in specific cases where you don't want clients to cache responses.

Please refer to the Express.js documentation for a complete list of supported settings 
that you can disable using app.disable(). Keep in mind that disabling certain settings 
may impact the behavior of your application, so use this method judiciously and only when 
you have a specific reason to do so.


4.app.enable()
This method is used to enable the settings like 
It can be one of the various application-level settings that Express supports,
such as 'etag', 'x-powered-by', 'query parser', 'strict routing', etc.
